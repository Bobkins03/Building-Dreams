# ARCHITECTURE

The main architecture of Building Dreams is divided into two parts: a frontend that serves the
user interface to clients and sends HTTP requests to the database, and a backend that
manages the database and responds to requests from the frontend.

The backend uses Django serializers to interpret data from the database and present the data
to the frontend through JSON. The API uses views for each database model so that it can
respond to any HTTP requests from the frontend.
